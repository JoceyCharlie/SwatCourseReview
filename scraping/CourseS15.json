Why is death bad? What is the meaning of life? (Does it have a meaning?) What can we know? What is knowledge? Are we just material beings or do we possess an immaterial (and, perhaps immortal) soul? These are and have always been fundamental philosophical questions.

We will take a historical approach, starting with Plato and then reading Descartes and Nietzsche before turning to more contemporary theorists like Frantz Fanon and Sandra Bartky. Throughout the course, we will pursue questions about truth (What is it? How does it relate to knowledge? When do we know that we know?) as well as questions about desire (What do we want? How does that relate to what we should want, our ideas of the good life, and the kind of life we should lead?) and the relationship between the two.\n\nSection 4: Knowledge and the World\n\n\u201cMen fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth\u2014more than ruin, more than even death.\u201d Bertrand Russell believed that education\u2019s primary goal should be to instill in students not only the ability to seek knowledge, but also the desire for it, the joy of it, and the appreciation of its power. For Russell, this was also an essential component of philosophy. In this course, we will investigate the quest for knowledge itself: what are we looking for and how should we be looking for it? We will read some of the canonical answers to these questions as well as some answers that are not so canonical.
