In class, we will take a look at the costume designer’s responsibilities as an artist and collaborator and explore the relationship between text, concept, and production. In addition to formal lecture, we will discuss fabrics and colors and how they relate to light and scenery in performance, and we will explore different medium and techniques for presentation of a design. A lab component of this class will introduce the student to costume shop operation and equipment in addition to a brief overview of costume history. The course is designed to serve all students regardless of prior experience in theater production.\n\nFulfills a general requirement for all theater majors and minors.",

        "summary": "From its earliest formations, jazz music has been inherently transcultural and particularly elemental to the cultural identity of individuals and communities identifying with the African Diaspora. This course posits improvisation—that is, encountering and working around borders while reacting to the impeding and facilitating possibilities they present—as a necessary and highly potent condition of cultural liminality. Accordingly, this course suggests that musical and cultural improvisatory performances can carve out discursive space within the socio-political systems that marginalize these communities. Drawing on the methodologies and scholarship of social sciences and the performing arts, we will explore this dynamic through interdisciplinary case studies in the Trans-Atlantic African Diaspora, with attention to local interpretations of global jazz culture and fusions of local music with jazz performance aesthetics. Also, the course will critically engage with the politics of collective identity, exploring how communities drawn together through a common genre marker or diasporic affiliation can themselves reproduce marginalizing hierarchies.",

        "summary": "This course introduces some of the major concepts and themes of modern political thought through a close reading of texts from the 16th to the early 20th century. The starting point of the course is Machiavelli’s novel “science” of statecraft, which identified the state as the focal point of political activity, and announced that a good politician must be prepared to act immorally, or even love his city more than his soul. In other words, we begin with the thought of politics as a distinct sphere of activity, centered around the state, and separable from other spheres such as morality and religion. The problem of the modern state and the relationship of the political to other domains of life will guide our exploration of the fundamental concepts and debates of modern political thought. Other themes we will discuss include secularism and toleration, absolutist and popular sovereignty, constitutionalism and individual rights, theories of war and colonialism, and the relationship between social and political forms of domination. Authors include Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant, Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, Mary Wollstonecraft, Karl Marx, Max Weber and W.E.B. Dubois.",

We will use theater games and improvisational exercises (from Stanislavsky, Viola Spolin, Uta Hagen and other sources) to unleash the actor’s imagination, expand the boundaries of accepted logic, encourage risk taking, and free the body and voice for the creative process. We will also focus on beginning to analyze text, understanding scene-work and monologues in relation to an entire play, listening and responding to self, others and space, and developing the ability to play actions. Finally, each student will have the opportunity to test our principles of work through one scene with a partner, no longer than ten minutes, to be assigned by the instructor. This scene will be performed in front of the class.\n\nFulfills a general requirement for all theater majors and minors.",

In this seminar, we will analyze the collapse of the received notions of the stable self in classical thought and then move toward a postmodern recovery of the self-that-is-not-a-self founded on the spiritual practice of solicitude for the other.

Questions about what motivates satirists to attack the behavior of their contemporaries and speculation about the quasi-religious roots of mockery have been fertile and contested areas of inquiry for centuries. We will read numerous thinkers (ancient and modern) who have proposed theories of the origins of comedy, including Aristotle, Freud, Bakhtin, Bergson, and Francis Cornford. And we will also encounter more recent comedians' reflections on their own birth and origins, including performers such as Richard Pryor, Howard Stern, Tina Fey, Louis CK, Sarah Silverman, Jon Stewart, and Lenny Bruce.\n\nHumanities. 1 credit.",

We will look at three central issues of politics— 1) Justice; 2) Freedom; 3) Power, Knowledge and Values—over the course of the semester. The course proceeds topically as well as chronologically, and we will return to certain primary classic theory texts more than once. Primary texts will include Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Mill, Marx and Foucault, as well as texts that present a contemporary perspective on each issue.\n\nThis course examines a range of arguments about the principles of justice—including rights, duties, utility, individual dignity, equality, and autonomy— that should govern our everyday behavior and our political experience. Authors include canonical theorists such as Plato, Xenophon, Kant, Bentham, Mill, Marx and Nietzsche, as well as more recent theorists such as Nozick, Rawls, Sandel and Nussbaum. Students will draw upon five modern movies (and) as a means of grounding the questions in a contemporary sensibility.",

You can let your friend know that there will probably be fewer than 25 trains from Elwyn to Gladstone next Wednesday—but could you do this without using language? (have you tried?) Even more interesting is the question how you can do this using language. How can the sounds I produce or the marks that I leave on this sheet of paper be about the dog outside chasing the squirrel? How can words refer to things and how can sentences be true or false? Where does meaning come from? Philosophy has dealt with such questions for a long time but it was only a bit more than 100 years ago that these questions have taken center stage in philosophy.

This course seeks to analyze the complex socio-political and cultural process that enabled these changes, and to challenge preconceived notions about gender and sexuality in Latin American shaped in the “progressive” center. A selected body of literature, essays and films will allow us to study the cultural politics of gender and sexuality in Latin America. We will explore these issues through theoretical concepts provided by Latin Americanists active in such fields as cultural studies, history, literary criticism, queer studies, and other relevant disciplines.",

In addition to theoretical questions, we will investigate one of the hottest debates in contemporary political science: whether political participation, social connectedness, and general cooperation have declined in the United States over the past half-century. If so, why? What might be done? We will consider the potential civic impact of economic and social marginalization in inner-city areas, the role of education in promoting civic engagement, the problem of civic and political disengagement among America’s youth, and the potential for the Internet and other communications technology to resuscitate democratic engagement among the citizenry. We will close by considering some lessons from successful community activists, politicians, and political mobilizers.",

Topics to be examined include the following: How do social factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class influence the way people use language? How do individual speakers use language differently in different situations? How do regional dialects differ from each other, and why? How does language change spread within a community and between communities? In learning the answers to these questions, students will carry out sociolinguistic field projects to collect and analyze data from real-life speech.",

It seeks to elicit an understanding of theory as a way of thinking about the world; theory as related to political practices and institutions; and theory as a form of politics. We will look at three central issues of politics— 1) Justice; 2) Freedom; 3) Power, Knowledge and Values—over the course of the semester. The course proceeds topically as well as chronologically, and we will return to certain primary classic theory texts more than once. Primary texts will include Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Mill, Marx and Foucault, as well as texts that present a contemporary perspective on each issue.\n\nThis course examines a range of arguments about the principles of justice—including rights, duties, utility, individual dignity, equality, and autonomy— that should govern our everyday behavior and our political experience. Authors include canonical theorists such as Plato, Xenophon, Kant, Bentham, Mill, Marx and Nietzsche, as well as more recent theorists such as Nozick, Rawls, Sandel and Nussbaum. Students will draw upon five modern movies (and) as a means of grounding the questions in a contemporary sensibility.",

In this survey of the mythology of Greco-Roman antiquity, we will investigate the diverse meanings of 'myth', its social functions, its origins, its history, and its contemporary relevance. Students will get a broad overview of Classical mythology through direct and close readings of primary sources (all in English translation), including such texts as Homer's , plays by all three of the major Greek tragedians (Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides), and Ovid's . Our readings of ancient texts will be supplemented by study of ancient art and frequent investigations of modern responses to and theorizing of myth in diverse fields and media, including sociological, psychological, and philosophical treatises; modern poetry; visual arts; and film.\n\nHumanities. 1 credit.",

Furthermore, we will pay special attention to those subjects in between different worlds, from Florida and Peru to Mozambique and Japan.

        "summary": "Philosophy addresses fundamental questions that arise in various practices and inquiries. Each section addresses a few of these questions to introduce a range of sharply contrasting positions. Readings are typically drawn from the works of both traditional and contemporary thinkers with distinctive, carefully argued, and influential views regarding knowledge, morality, mind, and meaning. Close attention is paid to formulating questions precisely and to the technique of analyzing arguments through careful consideration of texts.\n\nEach semester. Staff.\n\nSection 1: Knowledge and Agency\n\nWhat shall I do? What are the demands of morality? What is their basis (if there is one)? What is freedom of the will and do we enjoy it? Why is death bad? What is the meaning of life? (Does it have a meaning?) What can we know? What is knowledge? Are we just material beings or do we possess an immaterial (and, perhaps immortal) soul? These are and have always been fundamental philosophical questions. We will deal with them by reading and discussing classical as\n\nwell as contemporary philosophical texts.\n\nSection 3: Truth and Desire\n\nThis course is designed to develop your natural ability to think philosophically by heightening your sense of wonder and honing your critical skills. We will take a historical approach, starting with Plato and then reading Descartes and Nietzsche before turning to more contemporary theorists like Frantz Fanon and Sandra Bartky. Throughout the course, we will pursue questions about truth (What is it? How does it relate to knowledge? When do we know that we know?) as well as questions about desire (What do we want? How does that relate to what we should want, our ideas of the good life, and the kind of life we should lead?) and the relationship between the two.\n\nSection 4: Knowledge and the World\n\n“Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth—more than ruin, more than even death.” Bertrand Russell believed that education’s primary goal should be to instill in students not only the ability to seek knowledge, but also the desire for it, the joy of it, and the appreciation of its power. For Russell, this was also an essential component of philosophy. In this course, we will investigate the quest for knowledge itself: what are we looking for and how should we be looking for it? We will read some of the canonical answers to these questions as well as some answers that are not so canonical. We will ask what knowledge is, what kinds of knowledge we can have, and what it is exactly that we can know.",

It is the usual entry point to majoring or minoring in astronomy, astrophysics, or physics, and is a pre- or co-requisite for the sophomore-level physics major curriculum; it welcomes both non-majors and prospective majors who are interested in engaging rigorously and deeply with both the mathematical and conceptual descriptions of physics. Physics 005 will be taught seminar-style, with student presentation of problem solutions and ideas playing an essential role. Includes some afternoon labs and some evening telescope observing.

Over longer periods of time, these small changes build up to significant changes. (ii) As groups of speakers whose ancestors once spoke the same language become separated, their languages diverge. This leads to a split into separate daughter languages, which often end up being mutually incomprehensible. The question is, how is it possible to figure out and reconstruct the changes and splits that occurred in the distant past in languages that are no longer spoken and were perhaps never recorded? The method applied by historical linguists to solve this problem, the main focus of this course, is called the ‘comparative method.’ We will draw on material from a wide range of languages, focusing mainly on sound change and morphological analogy.\n\nPrerequisite: LING 001 or 045 or permission of the instructor.",

The primary emphasis will be on the stylistic, socio-political, and cultural dimensions of the New Wave, and the filmmakers and critics most closely associated with the movement. Directors who were once all film critics for the magazine —Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette, Eric Rohmer, and François Truffaut—will be studied along side other important filmmakers of the era Chris Marker, Alain Resnais and Agnès Varda.",

Through a multidisciplinary perspective, we will study the interaction of social, political, ethnic, and gender dynamics and its resulting transformations in Latin America. After a study of pre-European contact and Amerindian civilizations, we will examine critically the moment of contact between the Old and the New World and the ensuing conflicts that characterized the three centuries of colonial rule in Latin America. Later, we will focus on the nation building process and the cultural campaigns of turn-of-the-century elites, the causes and consequences of U.S. interventions, the dilemmas of economic development, the rise of state terror, and the lives of transnational migrants today. Lectures and textbook readings provide a panoramic analysis of complex cultural processes (colonialism, transculturation, modernization, globalization, etc.); documentaries and films provide other points of entry as we think through the processes that have shaped Latin America.\n\nPrerequisite: SPAN 004 or the equivalent or permission of the instructor.\n\nOffered each fall.",

Its focus is citizenship: as both an ideal of formal equality and a lived practice of political belonging that reflects and reproduces social inequity. The first half investigates how citizenship intersects with forms of difference such as race, class, gender, sexuality, and ability. Ethnographic examples include debates about the legal recognition of gay marriage, spatial struggles over the right to the city, and disability activism and the biopolitics of citizenship. The second half examines how new forms of mobility of people, ideas, and capital challenge the nation-state as the site of political membership. What is the state’s responsibility towards its “others”: from transnational entrepreneurs to illegal migrant workers, and from political refugees to the detainees at Guantanamo Bay?\n\nTheory course.",

        "summary": "Philosophy addresses fundamental questions that arise in various practices and inquiries. Each section addresses a few of these questions to introduce a range of sharply contrasting positions. Readings are typically drawn from the works of both traditional and contemporary thinkers with distinctive, carefully argued, and influential views regarding knowledge, morality, mind, and meaning. Close attention is paid to formulating questions precisely and to the technique of analyzing arguments through careful consideration of texts.\n\nEach semester. Staff.\n\nSection 1: Knowledge and Agency\n\nWhat shall I do? What are the demands of morality? What is their basis (if there is one)? What is freedom of the will and do we enjoy it? Why is death bad? What is the meaning of life? (Does it have a meaning?) What can we know? What is knowledge? Are we just material beings or do we possess an immaterial (and, perhaps immortal) soul? These are and have always been fundamental philosophical questions. We will deal with them by reading and discussing classical as\n\nwell as contemporary philosophical texts.\n\nSection 3: Truth and Desire\n\nThis course is designed to develop your natural ability to think philosophically by heightening your sense of wonder and honing your critical skills. We will take a historical approach, starting with Plato and then reading Descartes and Nietzsche before turning to more contemporary theorists like Frantz Fanon and Sandra Bartky. Throughout the course, we will pursue questions about truth (What is it? How does it relate to knowledge? When do we know that we know?) as well as questions about desire (What do we want? How does that relate to what we should want, our ideas of the good life, and the kind of life we should lead?) and the relationship between the two.\n\nSection 4: Knowledge and the World\n\n“Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth—more than ruin, more than even death.” Bertrand Russell believed that education’s primary goal should be to instill in students not only the ability to seek knowledge, but also the desire for it, the joy of it, and the appreciation of its power. For Russell, this was also an essential component of philosophy. In this course, we will investigate the quest for knowledge itself: what are we looking for and how should we be looking for it? We will read some of the canonical answers to these questions as well as some answers that are not so canonical. We will ask what knowledge is, what kinds of knowledge we can have, and what it is exactly that we can know.",

        "summary": "Described as the site of the last great revolution of the Modern Era, this course explores Iran’s recent political history as the expression of an “authentic” modernity, conceived by Iranians and articulated in local terms, both Islamic and pre-Islamic. Rather than treat the postrevolutionary politics of the Islamic Republic as a break with modernity or “a force spinning Iran back thirteen centuries in time,” the course examines continuities between the policies of the current regime and more than 200 years of effort in Iran, stretching back to the Qajar and Pahlavi monarchies, to reconcile European (and later, North American) modernity to Iranian culture and history. Special attention is given to ideology and political Islam, nationalism, the educational system, and the concepts of post-Islamism and social non-movements, particularly since the Green Movement and Arab Spring. The course places Iranian encounters with modernity into comparative perspective by looking at similar processes taking place in countries like Egypt and Turkey, and in Latin America.",

We will look at three central issues of politics— 1) Justice; 2) Freedom; 3) Power, Knowledge and Values—over the course of the semester. The course proceeds topically as well as chronologically, and we will return to certain primary classic theory texts more than once. Primary texts will include Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Mill, Marx and Foucault, as well as texts that present a contemporary perspective on each issue.\n\nThis course examines a range of arguments about the principles of justice—including rights, duties, utility, individual dignity, equality, and autonomy— that should govern our everyday behavior and our political experience. Authors include canonical theorists such as Plato, Xenophon, Kant, Bentham, Mill, Marx and Nietzsche, as well as more recent theorists such as Nozick, Rawls, Sandel and Nussbaum. Students will draw upon five modern movies (and) as a means of grounding the questions in a contemporary sensibility.",

Students will gain insight into how ideas of development fit into larger global dynamics of power and politics and how, contrary to professed goals, the practices of international development have often perpetuated poverty and widened the gap between rich and poor.

We will read texts by Europeans who encountered others and imposed upon them, but also texts by the defeated, where they tell their side of the story. Furthermore, we will pay special attention to those subjects in between different worlds, from Florida and Peru to Mozambique and Japan.

We will look at poetry, fiction, memoir, prison narratives, film, and experimental texts. Through the examination of a variety of experiences, genres, and perspectives, we will ask questions like: How do narratives of war contribute to the formation of national, local, and Arab identities? How has the experience of war impacted understandings of religion, masculinity, gender, and domestic violence? We will identify common themes and images, and also investigate how these patterns change and develop in different spatial and temporal contexts.",

But the Soviet era pursued science-fictional plans to redesign whole landscapes, make rivers flow backwards and even revolutionize plant genetics (Trofim Lysenko). In practice, such projects led to a shrinking Aral Sea, massive pollution of industrial and agricultural sites, and the worst nuclear disaster in human history (Chernobyl) – at great human cost. Writers have both supported industrial transformation and resisted industrialization. This course will trace the evolution of these elements of Russian culture, focusing on expressions of ideology in literature. No knowledge of Russian is necessary, but students with the language may do some reading in the original.",

Though wide ranging in our theoretical perspective, a deeply ethnographic approach to the lived experience of Islam in a number of cultural settings guides this study.",

Many believe that the expansion of the human brain evolved due to the complex demands of dealing with others - competing or cooperating with them, deceiving or empathizing with them, understanding or misjudging them.

Lectures, essays, and classroom debates will return over and over again to the following questions: What constitutes legitimate authority, and how is it reproduced? We will seek out answers by exploring how states, regimes, and governments in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and the Middle East conciliate difference and change, violently and non-violently, in relation to their respective societies.",

In each of these four sections, we will explore artworks from multiple geographies, including northern and southern Europe, couching the major artists and artworks of the Italian and Northern Renaissance within conceptual frameworks that highlight their interconnected nature and their relationship with other people, places, and movements.",

We then trace the rise of the Sikh tradition in the milieu of the Mughals, northern Hindu Sants and mendicant Sufis, popular goddess worship and village piety, focusing on several issues of religious experience. We then turn to the colonial and post-colonial period through the lenses of the Hindu saints, artists, and reformers (the “nationalist elite”) of the Bengali Renaissance, and the political and religious thought of Mohandas Gandhi and Dalit reformer Ambedkar. We will use perspectives of various theorists and social historians, from Ashis Nandy, Partha Chatterjee, Peter van der Veer, to Veena Das and Gail Omvedt.",

In the short span of 40 years, modern cosmology has transformed from a purely theoretical field to one overflowing with increasingly precise data. As a result, our picture of how the universe came into being and how it evolves in time has come into near-perfect focus: it seems as though, after thousands of years of thought, we may be on the cusp of understanding the physical nature of our ultimate origin. Although correct in certain respects, this sense of understanding may not be as founded as we might hope. We will critically explore the theoretical motivation and observational evidence that supports our modern cosmological model.

The goal of this course is to provide a chronology of the major works in the Western tradition and to provide the vocabulary and methodologies necessary to analyze these works of art closely in light of the material, historical, religious, social, and cultural circumstances in which they were produced and received. We will give attention to the use and status of materials; the representation of social relations, gender, religion, and politics; the context in which works of art were used and displayed; and the critical response these works elicited.",

        "summary": "Philosophy addresses fundamental questions that arise in various practices and inquiries. Each section addresses a few of these questions to introduce a range of sharply contrasting positions. Readings are typically drawn from the works of both traditional and contemporary thinkers with distinctive, carefully argued, and influential views regarding knowledge, morality, mind, and meaning. Close attention is paid to formulating questions precisely and to the technique of analyzing arguments through careful consideration of texts.\n\nEach semester. Staff.\n\nSection 1: Knowledge and Agency\n\nWhat shall I do? What are the demands of morality? What is their basis (if there is one)? What is freedom of the will and do we enjoy it? Why is death bad? What is the meaning of life? (Does it have a meaning?) What can we know? What is knowledge? Are we just material beings or do we possess an immaterial (and, perhaps immortal) soul? These are and have always been fundamental philosophical questions. We will deal with them by reading and discussing classical as\n\nwell as contemporary philosophical texts.\n\nSection 3: Truth and Desire\n\nThis course is designed to develop your natural ability to think philosophically by heightening your sense of wonder and honing your critical skills. We will take a historical approach, starting with Plato and then reading Descartes and Nietzsche before turning to more contemporary theorists like Frantz Fanon and Sandra Bartky. Throughout the course, we will pursue questions about truth (What is it? How does it relate to knowledge? When do we know that we know?) as well as questions about desire (What do we want? How does that relate to what we should want, our ideas of the good life, and the kind of life we should lead?) and the relationship between the two.\n\nSection 4: Knowledge and the World\n\n“Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth—more than ruin, more than even death.” Bertrand Russell believed that education’s primary goal should be to instill in students not only the ability to seek knowledge, but also the desire for it, the joy of it, and the appreciation of its power. For Russell, this was also an essential component of philosophy. In this course, we will investigate the quest for knowledge itself: what are we looking for and how should we be looking for it? We will read some of the canonical answers to these questions as well as some answers that are not so canonical. We will ask what knowledge is, what kinds of knowledge we can have, and what it is exactly that we can know.",

Must we choose? And are these questions themselves, and the talk they generate or suppress, yet another manifestation of the Western European and American commodification of art, its production, and its consumption? Such questions will underlie this introduction to the goals, methods, and history of art history. Focusing on works drawn from a variety of cultures and epochs, as well as on the art historical and critical attention those works have attracted, students will learn to describe, analyze, and interpret both images and their interpretations and to convey their own assessments in lucid writing and speaking.",

        "summary": "What is culture, and what is cultural studies? This course offers answers to both questions by examining what happens when an academic discipline forms around culture. Centering on a key figure - Stuart Hall – we will reconstruct the milieu of radically creative thinkers that formed the Birmingham Center for Contemporary Cultural Studies, including Raymond Williams, Richard Hoggart, Stuart Hall, Dick Hebdige, Catherine Hall, Angela McRobbie, Paul Gilroy, and others as they studied present cultural phenomena like adolescent femininity, punk music, hip-hop, advertising, and subcultures and reshaped the study of the past, from the black Atlantic to the Bengal Renaissance. By examining its major texts, figures and institutions, we will see how twentieth-century cultural studies promised to bring about new connections between academic work and public writing, new kinds of thinking about wealth, value and politics, new constellations of public art and social activism by reconfiguring existing disciplines, centering on new objects of study, and reimaging the role of the scholar.\n\nThroughout the semester, we will pay special attention to ways you may have attended to the idea of culture in your previous and current coursework and independent reading. What perhaps now-unseen relation does the idea of culture, and perhaps the legacy of cultural studies, have to your Swarthmore education as you have known it, and to your life before and after Swarthmore?\n\nAssignments will include both collaborative and individual projects, formal and informal writing, and attendance at some additional lectures. Expect visiting speakers, collaborative projects, comparative and interdisciplinary methodologies, digital methods, and more.\n\nPrerequisite, excepting seniors: Permission of the instructor.\n\nAzfar (History)and Sagner Buurma (English Literature).\"",

We will examine how artworks from the ancient Americas reflected, supported, and actively shaped the worldview of the people who created and used them. In addition, the class will briefly examine the significance of pre-Columbian art in contemporary society, including the topics of cultural nationalism, looting, and the politics of collecting pre-Columbian art.",

        "summary": "For decades the City of Philadelphia has been plagued by problems of population loss, violent crime, poverty, racial segregation, failing public schools and environmental pollution. While serious problems remain, parts of Philadelphia are experiencing a remarkable rebirth and the city has reversed its decades-long trend of population loss. This class will look at the historical development of economic and educational inequality and an effort to address them in South Philadelphia, a largely poor and working-class area undergoing some of the most dramatic social change in the city. For over a century South Philly has been among the city’s most diverse and culturally vibrant areas and a major gateway for immigrants from across the globe—most recently from several Asian countries and the Puebla region of Mexico. The class will travel to South Philly and see the neighborhood in walking tours. The course has a significant community-based learning component in which students will contribute to an on-going project at one of the city’s most diverse public schools: Andrew Jackson Elementary. Jackson’s principal has developed a vision for making the school a model of how a green curriculum can be a low-cost vehicle for under-resourced urban schools to achieve academic excellence. We will help build a rooftop garden where Jackson’s students will learn the science of environmental sustainability by growing their own food. Students will also work to develop the next phase of Jackson becoming a model green school by designing a science greenhouse foe aquaponic and hydroponic vegetable growing systems. Every aspect of this greenhouse will showcase principles of energy efficiency and foster learning of science and math. The goal is to create a classroom that demonstrates daily the potential of passive and active solar energy technologies, allowing Jackson’s students to explore first-hand a critical question: which one is really the expensive “alternative” energy source: solar or digging up carbon fuels and burning them?\n\nNote: Students who want to enroll/get credit for this as Educational Studies will need to have taken EDUC 014.",

Through careful attention given to literary texts, films, and cultural media, the students develop further their writing and oral skills in Spanish. The course focuses on providing myriad opportunities for students to integrate an advanced understanding of grammar with communication-oriented activities, therefore allowing for the expression of advanced concepts and ideas in speech and writing that will enable students to take upper-level Spanish courses in literature and culture.\n\nNote: Students who receive a final grade of “B-” or below in SPAN 004 need to take SPAN 008 as the next course in language sequence. Students who receive a final grad of “B” or higher in SPAN 004 may continue to SPAN 010 or SPAN 011.\n\nOffered each semester.",

The class will focus on concepts and practices surrounding the use of drawing as a visual language rather than as a preliminary or planning process. Whether students are interested in photography, painting, pottery, sculpture, installation or performance, the ability to design and compose visually is fundamental to their development. The course follows a sequence of studies that introduces students to basic drawing media and compositional elements while they also learn to see inventively.\n\nThis course is a prerequisite for all other courses in studio art except book arts unless waived by the instructor.\n\nEach semester.

We will focus primarily on the uses of erotic love (along with the body and the “passions”) in religious discourse—in poetry, commentary, and prose narratives—the many ways passionate love and/or sexuality are used cross-culturally to describe the relationship between the human and the divine. We will also explore other emotions and attitudes evoked by the word love: devotion, affection, friendship, “charity” (caritas), parental love, and the tensions of these forms of “love” with erotic love. Along with primary texts from the Greek, Jewish, Christian, Islamic, secular troubadour, and Hindu traditions, we will explore the theoretical writings of Martha Nussbaum, Peter Brown, David Halperin, Julia Kristeva, David Biale, Daniel Boyarin, Caroline Walker Bynum, Henry Corbin, Michael Sells, A.K. Ramanujan, Wendy Doniger, David Shulman, and Margaret Trawick. Such a thematic treatment of what we in the English-speaking West call “love” brings to the fore many important theoretical questions concerning the cultural construction of emotions, particular love and “ennobling virtues,” the erotic life, the body, and religion.",

We will discuss themes that emerge at the intersection of water history and water cinema: water as mystery/nature; water as social, political, and ecological crisis; water as dream of leisure and recreation; water as space of labor, economy, transit. The final project addresses a specific problem in the history of water through a creative and analytical lens.",

In recent decades, random assignment/experimental designs have increasingly been applied to estimate the impact of changes in policies on employment, welfare, housing, education, policing, public health, and community development. Social policy experiments and alternative methods to examine cause and effect will be covered, with emphasis on actual examples from the previously mentioned fields. Specific issues in design, implementation of such studies, the analysis of results, and translation to the policy context will be reviewed. Students will meet with selected analysts who carry out these types of studies. Students will do some analysis of data generated from quantitative studies of what works and for whom.\n\nPrerequisite: ECON 001.",

We will also focus on beginning to analyze text, understanding scene-work and monologues in relation to an entire play, listening and responding to self, others and space, and developing the ability to play actions. Finally, each student will have the opportunity to test our principles of work through one scene with a partner, no longer than ten minutes, to be assigned by the instructor. This scene will be performed in front of the class.\n\nFulfills a general requirement for all theater majors and minors.",

By comparing body modification through space and time, we ask questions such as: Is contemporary anorexia similar to wearing the corset during the 19th century? Is female circumcision different from breast implants? Furthermore, we investigate how embodiment shapes personal and collective identities (especially gender identities) and vice versa.",

In this interdisciplinary senior seminar, we will not only read, view and listen to primary media sources in their specific historical contexts, but we will also investigate and analyze media theories by Freud, Marx, Benjamin, Heidegger, Adorno, Brecht, Enzensberger, Habermas, Kracauer, and Kittler (among others) that develop alongside and in reaction to the rapidly changing mediascapes of 19th–21st century German-speaking countries. From print and popular press culture, letters and postcards, to radio, film, television and digital media, the seminar will devote two weeks to each major medium with authentic material made available on a course website and on reserve. Students are responsible for one oral presentation (submitted in written form a week later) and researching, composing and constructing a detailed analytical project in digital form in German, which they will present as a poster session at a German Studies event in early December.",

Marx demands that we take history and class conflict seriously in political theory. Nietzsche connects the evolution of human instinct to the politics of good and evil for the sake of political transformation. Jung establishes psychology and mythology as foundations for politics, and Foucault uses all three of these critics to question the modern subject and the disciplines of power and knowledge that construct selves and politics in a postmodern age.",

Focusing primarily on transcultural and interdisciplinary perspectives, we will explore topics pertaining to all periods of Spanish history, society, culture, literature, politics, art, music, and film. We will devote special attention to contemporary Spanish film and current events. We will study these aspects in relation to different regions (Cataluña, Andalucía, Galicia, País Vasco, and Castilla) and particular cities (Madrid, Barcelona, and Sevilla). We will examine how the medieval concept of Spain (“las Españas”) may still apply today with respect to the linguistic, cultural, ethnic, social, and political diversity within the Iberian Peninsula. Other topics for exploration include migration and the emergence of hybrid identities, including those pertaining to culture, gender, and sexuality. Students will develop advanced skills in speaking, writing, and reading in Spanish.\n\nPrerequisite: SPAN 004 or the equivalent or permission of the instructor.\n\nOffered each spring.",

        "summary": "Power, external and objective, is also internal and subjective, invisibly working to shape understandings of who we are even as it performs the visible rituals of regulation typically associated with states and governments. This course takes as its central thesis that immaterial and invisible forms of power are power’s most effective form as well as the most difficult for political science to measure and understand. Alternating between case and theory, and looking at power both naked and sublime, we will examine the struggle by the state and other elite actors to shape subjectivities through culture and identity formation in order to secure quiescence and rule. Close attention will be paid to how socializing agents, including schools and the educational system, media and film, and families and local communities, shape and reshape formal efforts to have ordinary citizens internalize what Stuart Hall describes as “the horizon of the taken-for-granted,” those ruling ideas and beliefs that consist “of things that go without saying because, being axiomatic, they come without saying; things that, being presumptively shared, are not normally the subject of explication or argument.” This course seeks to understand how such efforts succeed, falter, and change as they face the negotiations of the ordinary and the less powerful. Authors include Antonio Gramsci, Steven Lukes, James C. Scott, Clifford Geertz, Michel Foucault, Joel Migdal, Stuart Hall, and Robert Dahl.",

But the Soviet era pursued science-fictional plans to redesign whole landscapes, make rivers flow backwards and even\n\nrevolutionize plant genetics (Trofim Lysenko). In practice, such projects led to a shrinking Aral Sea, massive pollution of industrial and agricultural sites, and the worst nuclear disaster in human history (Chernobyl)—at great human cost. Writers have both supported industrial transformation and resisted industrialization. This course will trace the evolution of these elements of Russian culture, focusing on expressions of ideology in literature.

        "summary": "Access to fresh water is an acute issue for the 21st century, and yet civilizations have designed a wide range of inventive projects for accessing and controlling water supplies over the centuries. Fresh water resource allocation generates issues between upstream and downstream users, between a country and its neighbors, between urban and rural residents, and between states and regions. This course examines a range of fresh water issues, comparing China and the U.S. Topics include dams and large-scale water projects (e.g., rerouting rivers); water pollution; groundwater depletion; industrial water use (e.g., for hydrofracking); impact of agricultural practices; urban storm water management; wetlands conservation; desertification; desalination. In the U.S. context especially, issues of water rights regimes and property rights, privatization, and commodification of water will receive attention. Which claims upon fresh water resources come first? What role do governments, transnational organizations, corporations, NGOs, and grassroots citizens’ movements play in these water decisions? Guest lectures will emphasize science and engineering perspectives on water management. Chinese language ability desirable but not required.",

Course topics include ecological thought in Western philosophy, theology, and biblical studies; the role of Asian religious thought in forging an ecological worldview; the value of American nature writings for environmental awareness, including both Euro-American and Amerindian literatures; the public policy debates concerning vegetarianism and the antitoxics movement; and the contemporary relevance of ecofeminism, deep ecology, Neopaganism, and wilderness activism.
