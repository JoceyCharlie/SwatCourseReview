In class, we will take a look at the costume designer\u2019s responsibilities as an artist and collaborator and explore the relationship between text, concept, and production. In addition to formal lecture, we will discuss fabrics and colors and how they relate to light and scenery in performance, and we will explore different medium and techniques for presentation of a design. A lab component of this class will introduce the student to costume shop operation and equipment in addition to a brief overview of costume history. The course is designed to serve all students regardless of prior experience in theater production.\n\n Fulfills a general requirement for all theater majors and minors."

This course posits improvisation\u2014that is, encountering and working around borders while reacting to the impeding and facilitating possibilities they present\u2014as a necessary and highly potent condition of cultural liminality. Accordingly, this course suggests that musical and cultural improvisatory performances can carve out discursive space within the socio-political systems that marginalize these communities. Drawing on the methodologies and scholarship of social sciences and the performing arts, we will explore this dynamic through interdisciplinary case studies in the Trans-Atlantic African Diaspora, with attention to local interpretations of global jazz culture and fusions of local music with jazz performance aesthetics. Also, the course will critically engage with the politics of collective identity, exploring how communities drawn together through a common genre marker or diasporic affiliation can themselves reproduce marginalizing hierarchies."

The starting point of the course is Machiavelli\u2019s novel \u201cscience\u201d of statecraft, which identified the state as the focal point of political activity, and announced that a good politician must be prepared to act immorally, or even love his city more than his soul. In other words, we begin with the thought of politics as a distinct sphere of activity, centered around the state, and separable from other spheres such as morality and religion. The problem of the modern state and the relationship of the political to other domains of life will guide our exploration of the fundamental concepts and debates of modern political thought. Other themes we will discuss include secularism and toleration, absolutist and popular sovereignty, constitutionalism and individual rights, theories of war and colonialism, and the relationship between social and political forms of domination. Authors include Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant, Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, Mary Wollstonecraft, Karl Marx, Max Weber and W.E.B. Dubois."

In this course, you will learn the grammar and vocabulary required to experience the Hebrew Bible and ancient Hebrew commentaries in the original language. You will learn to use dictionaries, concordances, and translations to investigate word roots and to authenticate interpretations of the texts. In addition to teaching basic language skills, this course offers students the opportunity for direct encounter with primary biblical, rabbinic, and Jewish liturgical sources. No experience necessary. If you already have some Hebrew competence, contact the instructor for advice."

We will use theater games and improvisational exercises (from Stanislavsky, Viola Spolin, Uta Hagen and other sources) to unleash the actor\u2019s imagination, expand the boundaries of accepted logic, encourage risk taking, and free the body and voice for the creative process. We will also focus on beginning to analyze text, understanding scene-work and monologues in relation to an entire play, listening and responding to self, others and space, and developing the ability to play actions. Finally, each student will have the opportunity to test our principles of work through one scene with a partner, no longer than ten minutes, to be assigned by the instructor. This scene will be performed in front of the class.\n\n Fulfills a general requirement for all theater majors and minors."

In this seminar, we will analyze the collapse of the received notions of the stable self in classical thought and then move toward a postmodern recovery of the self-that-is-not-a-self founded on the spiritual practice of solicitude for the other. Readings may include Plato, Augustine, Rumi, Kierkegaard, Weil, Nishitani, Bonhoeffer, Levinas, Thich Nhat Hanh, and Dillard. This discussion-rich seminar includes regular student presentations and a community service-learning component."

We will use theater games and improvisational exercises (from Stanislavsky, Viola Spolin, Uta Hagen and other sources) to unleash the actor\u2019s imagination, expand the boundaries of accepted logic, encourage risk taking, and free the body and voice for the creative process. We will also focus on beginning to analyze text, understanding scene-work and monologues in relation to an entire play, listening and responding to self, others and space, and developing the ability to play actions. Finally, each student will have the opportunity to test our principles of work through one scene with a partner, no longer than ten minutes, to be assigned by the instructor. This scene will be performed in front of the class.\n\n Fulfills a general requirement for all theater majors and minors."

Questions about what motivates satirists to attack the behavior of their contemporaries and speculation about the quasi-religious roots of mockery have been fertile and contested areas of inquiry for centuries. We will read numerous thinkers (ancient and modern) who have proposed theories of the origins of comedy, including Aristotle, Freud, Bakhtin, Bergson, and Francis Cornford. And we will also encounter more recent comedians' reflections on their own birth and origins, including performers such as Richard Pryor, Howard Stern, Tina Fey, Louis CK, Sarah Silverman, Jon Stewart, and Lenny Bruce. \n\n Humanities. 1 credit."

The course proceeds topically as well as chronologically, and we will return to certain primary classic theory texts more than once. Primary texts will include Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Mill, Marx and Foucault, as well as texts that present a contemporary perspective on each issue. \n\nThis course examines a range of arguments about the principles of justice\u2014including rights, duties, utility, individual dignity, equality, and autonomy\u2014 that should govern our everyday behavior and our political experience. Authors include canonical theorists such as Plato, Xenophon, Kant, Bentham, Mill, Marx and Nietzsche, as well as more recent theorists such as Nozick, Rawls, Sandel and Nussbaum. Students will draw upon five modern movies (and) as a means of grounding the questions in a contemporary sensibility."

Complemented with readings in English about Chinese characters and classical Chinese, this course imparts the principal structures of the classical language through an analytical presentation of the rudiments of the language and close reading of original texts. It is not a lecture course and requires active, regular participation on the part of the student, with precise translation into English an integral component. The course is conducted in English. The course is open to all interested students and has no prerequisites; no previous preparation in Chinese is required."

Topics include the role of poetry in courtship, communication, religion, and ritual; orality and the graphic tradition; the influence of poetic models from China and the West; social networks and game aesthetics in renga linked poetry; and haiku as a worldwide poetic form. Course projects will include translation and composition in addition to analytical writing. Readings will be in English, and there are no language requirements or other prerequisites; however, the course will include a close examination of Japanese poetic sound, syntax, meter, and diction, or how the poems \u201cwork\u201d in the original language."

If any of these conditions or characteristics are necessary, how might they be promoted? In addition to theoretical questions, we will investigate one of the hottest debates in contemporary political science: whether political participation, social connectedness, and general cooperation have declined in the United States over the past half-century. If so, why? What might be done? We will consider the potential civic impact of economic and social marginalization in inner-city areas, the role of education in promoting civic engagement, the problem of civic and political disengagement among America\u2019s youth, and the potential for the Internet and other communications technology to resuscitate democratic engagement among the citizenry. We will close by considering some lessons from successful community activists, politicians, and political mobilizers."

Screenings will include films by Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kurosawa, Imamura, Kitano, and Miyazaki.\n\nLITR 025A War in Arab Literature and Cinema\n\n This course will explore literary and cinematic representations of war in the Arab world, focusing on the Arab-Israeli Conflict, the Lebanese Civil War, and the Iraq wars. We will look at poetry, fiction, memoir, prison narratives, film, and experimental texts. Through the examination of a variety of experiences, genres, and perspectives, we will ask questions like: How do narratives of war contribute to the formation of national, local, and Arab identities? How has the experience of war impacted understandings of religion, masculinity, gender, and domestic violence? We will identify common themes and images, and also investigate how these patterns change and develop in different spatial and temporal contexts."

Authors include canonical theorists such as Plato, Xenophon, Kant, Bentham, Mill, Marx and Nietzsche, as well as more recent theorists such as Nozick, Rawls, Sandel and Nussbaum.

The course is intended for students who want a practical introduction to statistical methods and who intend to do, or think they may eventually do, statistical analysis, especially in the biological and social sciences. Students who receive credit on entrance for the Statistics AP Exam should not take this course; they have placed out of it and will lose their AP credit if they take it. Note that STAT 011 overlaps considerably with ECON 031; both courses cover similar topics, although ECON 031 focuses more on economic applications while STAT 011 draws examples from a variety of disciplines.\n\n Prerequisite: Four years of traditional high school mathematics (precalculus).\n\n Each semester."

Combining classic theoretical readings on the structure and development of capitalism with concrete ethnographic studies, we will analyze a broad sample of the many guises under which capital travels across political, economic, and cultural borders. These analyses will then enable us to approach the more pressing question of how individual actors can and do contribute to the transformation of the global cultural economy.\n\n Theory course."

We will read and discuss a range of studies employing these methods. Throughout the semester students will gain firsthand experience using these methods. This course will include a significant community-based learning component. Students will help to design a research study for a public elementary school, Andrew Jackson Elementary, in Philadelphia. This study will focus on why parents choose charter schools rather than their local neighborhood school. The project will aid Jackson in its efforts to attract more families from the surrounding neighborhood and may contribute to a critical debate about school choice in Philadelphia. \n\n Methods course."

Each section addresses a few of these questions to introduce a range of sharply contrasting positions. Readings are typically drawn from the works of both traditional and contemporary thinkers with distinctive, carefully argued, and influential views regarding knowledge, morality, mind, and meaning. Close attention is paid to formulating questions precisely and to the technique of analyzing arguments through careful consideration of texts.\n\n Each semester. Staff.\n\nSection 1: Knowledge and Agency\n\nWhat shall I do? What are the demands of morality? What is their basis (if there is one)? What is freedom of the will and do we enjoy it? Why is death bad? What is the meaning of life? (Does it have a meaning?) What can we know? What is knowledge? Are we just material beings or do we possess an immaterial (and, perhaps immortal) soul? These are and have always been fundamental philosophical questions. We will deal with them by reading and discussing classical as \n\n well as contemporary philosophical texts.\n\nSection 3: Truth and Desire\n\nThis course is designed to develop your natural ability to think philosophically by heightening your sense of wonder and honing your critical skills. We will take a historical approach, starting with Plato and then reading Descartes and Nietzsche before turning to more contemporary theorists like Frantz Fanon and Sandra Bartky. Throughout the course, we will pursue questions about truth (What is it? How does it relate to knowledge? When do we know that we know?) as well as questions about desire (What do we want? How does that relate to what we should want, our ideas of the good life, and the kind of life we should lead?) and the relationship between the two.\n\nSection 4: Knowledge and the World\n\n\u201cMen fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth\u2014more than ruin, more than even death.\u201d Bertrand Russell believed that education\u2019s primary goal should be to instill in students not only the ability to seek knowledge, but also the desire for it, the joy of it, and the appreciation of its power. For Russell, this was also an essential component of philosophy. In this course, we will investigate the quest for knowledge itself: what are we looking for and how should we be looking for it? We will read some of the canonical answers to these questions as well as some answers that are not so canonical. We will ask what knowledge is, what kinds of knowledge we can have, and what it is exactly that we can know."

Centering on a key figure - Stuart Hall \u2013 we will reconstruct the milieu of radically creative thinkers that formed the Birmingham Center for Contemporary Cultural Studies, including Raymond Williams, Richard Hoggart, Stuart Hall, Dick Hebdige, Catherine Hall, Angela McRobbie, Paul Gilroy, and others as they studied present cultural phenomena like adolescent femininity, punk music, hip-hop, advertising, and subcultures and reshaped the study of the past, from the black Atlantic to the Bengal Renaissance. By examining its major texts, figures and institutions, we will see how twentieth-century cultural studies promised to bring about new connections between academic work and public writing, new kinds of thinking about wealth, value and politics, new constellations of public art and social activism by reconfiguring existing disciplines, centering on new objects of study, and reimaging the role of the scholar.\n\nThroughout the semester, we will pay special attention to ways you may have attended to the idea of culture in your previous and current coursework and independent reading. What perhaps now-unseen relation does the idea of culture, and perhaps the legacy of cultural studies, have to your Swarthmore education as you have known it, and to your life before and after Swarthmore?\n\nAssignments will include both collaborative and individual projects, formal and informal writing, and attendance at some additional lectures. Expect visiting speakers, collaborative projects, comparative and interdisciplinary methodologies, digital methods, and more. \n\nPrerequisite, excepting seniors: Permission of the instructor.\n\nAzfar (History)and Sagner Buurma (English Literature).\""

            "summary": "This course is an introduction to the study of linguistic history in the following sense: (i) The languages we are speaking are constantly changing. Over longer periods of time, these small changes build up to significant changes. (ii) As groups of speakers whose ancestors once spoke the same language become separated, their languages diverge. This leads to a split into separate daughter languages, which often end up being mutually incomprehensible. The question is, how is it possible to figure out and reconstruct the changes and splits that occurred in the distant past in languages that are no longer spoken and were perhaps never recorded? The method applied by historical linguists to solve this problem, the main focus of this course, is called the \u2018comparative method.\u2019 We will draw on material from a wide range of languages, focusing mainly on sound change and morphological analogy.\n\n Prerequisite: LING 001 or 045 or permission of the instructor."

Through a multidisciplinary perspective, we will study the interaction of social, political, ethnic, and gender dynamics and its resulting transformations in Latin America. After a study of pre-European contact and Amerindian civilizations, we will examine critically the moment of contact between the Old and the New World and the ensuing conflicts that characterized the three centuries of colonial rule in Latin America. Later, we will focus on the nation building process and the cultural campaigns of turn-of-the-century elites, the causes and consequences of U.S. interventions, the dilemmas of economic development, the rise of state terror, and the lives of transnational migrants today. Lectures and textbook readings provide a panoramic analysis of complex cultural processes (colonialism, transculturation, modernization, globalization, etc.); documentaries and films provide other points of entry as we think through the processes that have shaped Latin America. \n\n Prerequisite: SPAN 004 or the equivalent or permission of the instructor.\n\n Offered each fall."

Ethnographic examples include debates about the legal recognition of gay marriage, spatial struggles over the right to the city, and disability activism and the biopolitics of citizenship. The second half examines how new forms of mobility of people, ideas, and capital challenge the nation-state as the site of political membership.

Each section addresses a few of these questions to introduce a range of sharply contrasting positions. Readings are typically drawn from the works of both traditional and contemporary thinkers with distinctive, carefully argued, and influential views regarding knowledge, morality, mind, and meaning. Close attention is paid to formulating questions precisely and to the technique of analyzing arguments through careful consideration of texts.\n\n Each semester. Staff.\n\nSection 1: Knowledge and Agency\n\nWhat shall I do? What are the demands of morality? What is their basis (if there is one)? What is freedom of the will and do we enjoy it? Why is death bad? What is the meaning of life? (Does it have a meaning?) What can we know? What is knowledge? Are we just material beings or do we possess an immaterial (and, perhaps immortal) soul? These are and have always been fundamental philosophical questions. We will deal with them by reading and discussing classical as \n\n well as contemporary philosophical texts.\n\nSection 3: Truth and Desire\n\nThis course is designed to develop your natural ability to think philosophically by heightening your sense of wonder and honing your critical skills. We will take a historical approach, starting with Plato and then reading Descartes and Nietzsche before turning to more contemporary theorists like Frantz Fanon and Sandra Bartky. Throughout the course, we will pursue questions about truth (What is it? How does it relate to knowledge? When do we know that we know?) as well as questions about desire (What do we want? How does that relate to what we should want, our ideas of the good life, and the kind of life we should lead?) and the relationship between the two.\n\nSection 4: Knowledge and the World\n\n\u201cMen fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth\u2014more than ruin, more than even death.\u201d Bertrand Russell believed that education\u2019s primary goal should be to instill in students not only the ability to seek knowledge, but also the desire for it, the joy of it, and the appreciation of its power. For Russell, this was also an essential component of philosophy. In this course, we will investigate the quest for knowledge itself: what are we looking for and how should we be looking for it? We will read some of the canonical answers to these questions as well as some answers that are not so canonical. We will ask what knowledge is, what kinds of knowledge we can have, and what it is exactly that we can know."

Taboo terms also vary in how they are used: exclamations, name-calling, and maledictions are common, but other uses can appear, such as modifiers and predicates. Over time less common uses tend to semantically bleach, so that historical taboo terms can be used without hint of vulgarity or rudeness. These less common uses can fall together with slang in exhibiting linguistic behavior unique within that language, at the word level and the phrase and sentence level, behavior that is telling with respect to linguistic theory. Each student will choose a language other than English to investigate."

Rather than treat the postrevolutionary politics of the Islamic Republic as a break with modernity or \u201ca force spinning Iran back thirteen centuries in time,\u201d the course examines continuities between the policies of the current regime and more than 200 years of effort in Iran, stretching back to the Qajar and Pahlavi monarchies, to reconcile European (and later, North American) modernity to Iranian culture and history. Special attention is given to ideology and political Islam, nationalism, the educational system, and the concepts of post-Islamism and social non-movements, particularly since the Green Movement and Arab Spring. The course places Iranian encounters with modernity into comparative perspective by looking at similar processes taking place in countries like Egypt and Turkey, and in Latin America."

We will look at three central issues of politics\u2014 1) Justice; 2) Freedom; 3) Power, Knowledge and Values\u2014over the course of the semester. The course proceeds topically as well as chronologically, and we will return to certain primary classic theory texts more than once. Primary texts will include Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Mill, Marx and Foucault, as well as texts that present a contemporary perspective on each issue. \n\nThis course examines a range of arguments about the principles of justice\u2014including rights, duties, utility, individual dignity, equality, and autonomy\u2014 that should govern our everyday behavior and our political experience. Authors include canonical theorists such as Plato, Xenophon, Kant, Bentham, Mill, Marx and Nietzsche, as well as more recent theorists such as Nozick, Rawls, Sandel and Nussbaum. Students will draw upon five modern movies (and) as a means of grounding the questions in a contemporary sensibility."

This course will provide students with an introduction to the origin and evolution of ideas about development, and will encourage them to examine major theories and approaches to development from classical modernization theories to world-systems theories. Students will gain insight into how ideas of development fit into larger global dynamics of power and politics and how, contrary to professed goals, the practices of international development have often perpetuated poverty and widened the gap between rich and poor. During the course, we will investigate these issues through an array of texts that address different audiences including a novel, academic books and journals, film, popular writings and ethnographic monographs.\n\n Theory course and writing course."

Within this framework, we will discuss the work of major writers (Borges, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Vargas Llosa, Fuentes, Neruda) as well as emerging writers. Since we will also be mapping the representation of race, class, and gender, close attention will be given to selected works in literary theory, gender and queer theory, and cultural studies. \n\n Prerequisite: SPAN 004 or the equivalent or permission of the instructor.\n\n Offered each spring."

We will read texts by Europeans who encountered others and imposed upon them, but also texts by the defeated, where they tell their side of the story. Furthermore, we will pay special attention to those subjects in between different worlds, from Florida and Peru to Mozambique and Japan.

But the Soviet era pursued science-fictional plans to redesign whole landscapes, make rivers flow backwards and even revolutionize plant genetics (Trofim Lysenko). In practice, such projects led to a shrinking Aral Sea, massive pollution of industrial and agricultural sites, and the worst nuclear disaster in human history (Chernobyl) \u2013 at great human cost. Writers have both supported industrial transformation and resisted industrialization. This course will trace the evolution of these elements of Russian culture, focusing on expressions of ideology in literature. No knowledge of Russian is necessary, but students with the language may do some reading in the original."

Students will get a broad overview of Classical mythology through direct and close readings of primary sources (all in English translation), including such texts as Homer's , plays by all three of the major Greek tragedians (Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides), and Ovid's . Our readings of ancient texts will be supplemented by study of ancient art and frequent investigations of modern responses to and theorizing of myth in diverse fields and media, including sociological, psychological, and philosophical treatises; modern poetry; visual arts; and film. \n\n Humanities. 1 credit."

Many believe that the expansion of the human brain evolved due to the complex demands of dealing with others - competing or cooperating with them, deceiving or empathizing with them, understanding or misjudging them. In this course, we review current theories and methods guiding social, cognitive, and affective neuroscience, taking a multi-level approach to understanding the brain in its social context.\n\n Prerequisite: PSYC 001.\n\n Social sciences."

Assignments will include conducting interviews with educators and producing mixed media projects that reframe educator identities."

What might a comparative examination of the Egyptian Arab Spring and the Indian decolonization movement teach us about the promises and conceptual limitations of revolutionary action? Is the United States \u201cexceptional\u201d in its politics, or is it a pale rival to the \u201cpost-national\u201d project of the EU? This course asks students to push against conventional wisdom, the \u201cobvious\u201d and \u201cpermanent\u201d truths of political and social life, to seek falsifiable, testable explanations for the anomalies, gaps, and mysteries in the domestic politics of states and countries. Lectures, essays, and classroom debates will return over and over again to the following questions: What constitutes legitimate authority, and how is it reproduced? We will seek out answers by exploring how states, regimes, and governments in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and the Middle East conciliate difference and change, violently and non-violently, in relation to their respective societies."

In place of the staunch independence of Lucretius and the outrageous irreverence of Catullus, the new poets Propertius, Horace, and Vergil wrote poetry that responded directly or indirectly to the new political world. This course will explore one or more of these poets in depth, both within their political context and within the broader literary tradition. Students will read modern scholarly criticism, and develop their own critical approaches to writing about Latin poetry. They will also review basic Latin morphology and syntax, and build a stronger Latin vocabulary. The course is suitable for those with 3-4 years of High School Latin, or 1-2 years of Latin in college. \n\n Humanities. 1 credit."

In each of these four sections, we will explore artworks from multiple geographies, including northern and southern Europe, couching the major artists and artworks of the Italian and Northern Renaissance within conceptual frameworks that highlight their interconnected nature and their relationship with other people, places, and movements."

We then trace the rise of the Sikh tradition in the milieu of the Mughals, northern Hindu Sants and mendicant Sufis, popular goddess worship and village piety, focusing on several issues of religious experience. We then turn to the colonial and post-colonial period through the lenses of the Hindu saints, artists, and reformers (the \u201cnationalist elite\u201d) of the Bengali Renaissance, and the political and religious thought of Mohandas Gandhi and Dalit reformer Ambedkar. We will use perspectives of various theorists and social historians, from Ashis Nandy, Partha Chatterjee, Peter van der Veer, to Veena Das and Gail Omvedt."

In the short span of 40 years, modern cosmology has transformed from a purely theoretical field to one overflowing with increasingly precise data. As a result, our picture of how the universe came into being and how it evolves in time has come into near-perfect focus: it seems as though, after thousands of years of thought, we may be on the cusp of understanding the physical nature of our ultimate origin. Although correct in certain respects, this sense of understanding may not be as founded as we might hope. We will critically explore the theoretical motivation and observational evidence that supports our modern cosmological model. We will also discuss the social and philosophical implications of humanity\u2019s attempts to understand and order the cosmos."

Each section addresses a few of these questions to introduce a range of sharply contrasting positions. Readings are typically drawn from the works of both traditional and contemporary thinkers with distinctive, carefully argued, and influential views regarding knowledge, morality, mind, and meaning. Close attention is paid to formulating questions precisely and to the technique of analyzing arguments through careful consideration of texts.\n\n Each semester. Staff.\n\nSection 1: Knowledge and Agency\n\nWhat shall I do? What are the demands of morality? What is their basis (if there is one)? What is freedom of the will and do we enjoy it? Why is death bad? What is the meaning of life? (Does it have a meaning?) What can we know? What is knowledge? Are we just material beings or do we possess an immaterial (and, perhaps immortal) soul? These are and have always been fundamental philosophical questions. We will deal with them by reading and discussing classical as \n\n well as contemporary philosophical texts.\n\nSection 3: Truth and Desire\n\nThis course is designed to develop your natural ability to think philosophically by heightening your sense of wonder and honing your critical skills. We will take a historical approach, starting with Plato and then reading Descartes and Nietzsche before turning to more contemporary theorists like Frantz Fanon and Sandra Bartky. Throughout the course, we will pursue questions about truth (What is it? How does it relate to knowledge? When do we know that we know?) as well as questions about desire (What do we want? How does that relate to what we should want, our ideas of the good life, and the kind of life we should lead?) and the relationship between the two.\n\nSection 4: Knowledge and the World\n\n\u201cMen fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth\u2014more than ruin, more than even death.\u201d Bertrand Russell believed that education\u2019s primary goal should be to instill in students not only the ability to seek knowledge, but also the desire for it, the joy of it, and the appreciation of its power. For Russell, this was also an essential component of philosophy. In this course, we will investigate the quest for knowledge itself: what are we looking for and how should we be looking for it? We will read some of the canonical answers to these questions as well as some answers that are not so canonical. We will ask what knowledge is, what kinds of knowledge we can have, and what it is exactly that we can know."

This course seeks to analyze the complex socio-political and cultural process that enabled these changes, and to challenge preconceived notions about gender and sexuality in Latin American shaped in the \u201cprogressive\u201d center. A selected body of literature, essays and films will allow us to study the cultural politics of gender and sexuality in Latin America. We will explore these issues through theoretical concepts provided by Latin Americanists active in such fields as cultural studies, history, literary criticism, queer studies, and other relevant disciplines."

While serious problems remain, parts of Philadelphia are experiencing a remarkable rebirth and the city has reversed its decades-long trend of population loss. This class will look at the historical development of economic and educational inequality and an effort to address them in South Philadelphia, a largely poor and working-class area undergoing some of the most dramatic social change in the city. For over a century South Philly has been among the city\u2019s most diverse and culturally vibrant areas and a major gateway for immigrants from across the globe\u2014most recently from several Asian countries and the Puebla region of Mexico. The class will travel to South Philly and see the neighborhood in walking tours. The course has a significant community-based learning component in which students will contribute to an on-going project at one of the city\u2019s most diverse public schools: Andrew Jackson Elementary. Jackson\u2019s principal has developed a vision for making the school a model of how a green curriculum can be a low-cost vehicle for under-resourced urban schools to achieve academic excellence. We will help build a rooftop garden where Jackson\u2019s students will learn the science of environmental sustainability by growing their own food. Students will also work to develop the next phase of Jackson becoming a model green school by designing a science greenhouse foe aquaponic and hydroponic vegetable growing systems. Every aspect of this greenhouse will showcase principles of energy efficiency and foster learning of science and math. The goal is to create a classroom that demonstrates daily the potential of passive and active solar energy technologies, allowing Jackson\u2019s students to explore first-hand a critical question: which one is really the expensive \u201calternative\u201d energy source: solar or digging up carbon fuels and burning them?\n\n Note: Students who want to enroll/get credit for this as Educational Studies will need to have taken EDUC 014."

We will read texts by Europeans who encountered others and imposed upon them, but also texts by the defeated, where they tell their side of the story. Furthermore, we will pay special attention to those subjects in between different worlds, from Florida and Peru to Mozambique and Japan.

We consider how screenplays differ from other dramatic forms and understand what makes good cinematic storytelling. By looking at short and feature-length scripts and films, we examine issues of structure, character development, effective use of dramatic tension and dialogue, tone, and theme. Through in-class exercises and discussions, students flesh out their ideas and grapple with their writing in a supportive workshop atmosphere. Coursework includes screenings, short assignments, and the completion of several drafts of a short screenplay. By application only. No previous writing experience required."

To better understand the cultural and social significance of the objects we study, we will look to a variety of disciplinary approaches including art history, archeology, anthropology, ethnography. We will examine how artworks from the ancient Americas reflected, supported, and actively shaped the worldview of the people who created and used them. In addition, the class will briefly examine the significance of pre-Columbian art in contemporary society, including the topics of cultural nationalism, looting, and the politics of collecting pre-Columbian art."

How do we crack the visual codes specific to images, objects, and structures of a given time and place? This colloquium will explore various approaches to the interpretation of the visual arts through the critical reading of important texts of the discipline and writings that propose or challenge a variety of analytic strategies. Students will directly engage in the interpretive process by researching, writing, and presenting on a work of art or architecture in the Philadelphia area, an exercise that will assist the exploration of questions central to their own interest in the study of visual culture. Through this course students will acquire the skills for interpreting images we encounter every day\u2014such as advertisements, logos, icons, and other forms of visual culture."

Along with primary texts from the Greek, Jewish, Christian, Islamic, secular troubadour, and Hindu traditions, we will explore the theoretical writings of Martha Nussbaum, Peter Brown, David Halperin, Julia Kristeva, David Biale, Daniel Boyarin, Caroline Walker Bynum, Henry Corbin, Michael Sells, A.K. Ramanujan, Wendy Doniger, David Shulman, and Margaret Trawick.

We will read both canonical and non-canonical texts beginning in the 18th century and extending into the 21st that engage with themes of love, education and crisis. What do these narratives reveal about national, cultural and individual identity formation during early stages of maturity? How are these narratives shaped by various political and historical contexts? In addition to works by authors such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Frank Wedekind, Ingeborg Bachmann, Bernhard Schlink, and Jana Hensel, we will also examine key theoretical texts and films that focus on narratives of youth."

Topics to be examined include the following: How do social factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class influence the way people use language? How do individual speakers use language differently in different situations? How do regional dialects differ from each other, and why? How does language change spread within a community and between communities? In learning the answers to these questions, students will carry out sociolinguistic field projects to collect and analyze data from real-life speech."

Particular focus will be on attempts to establish whether such policy interventions can cause changes in outcomes for individuals, corporations, or communities. In recent decades, random assignment/experimental designs have increasingly been applied to estimate the impact of changes in policies on employment, welfare, housing, education, policing, public health, and community development. Social policy experiments and alternative methods to examine cause and effect will be covered, with emphasis on actual examples from the previously mentioned fields. Specific issues in design, implementation of such studies, the analysis of results, and translation to the policy context will be reviewed. Students will meet with selected analysts who carry out these types of studies. Students will do some analysis of data generated from quantitative studies of what works and for whom.\n\n Prerequisite: ECON 001."

We will use theater games and improvisational exercises (from Stanislavsky, Viola Spolin, Uta Hagen and other sources) to unleash the actor\u2019s imagination, expand the boundaries of accepted logic, encourage risk taking, and free the body and voice for the creative process. We will also focus on beginning to analyze text, understanding scene-work and monologues in relation to an entire play, listening and responding to self, others and space, and developing the ability to play actions. Finally, each student will have the opportunity to test our principles of work through one scene with a partner, no longer than ten minutes, to be assigned by the instructor. This scene will be performed in front of the class.\n\n Fulfills a general requirement for all theater majors and minors."

In the second part, we focus on in-depth ethnographic cases and compare diverse cultural practices that range from the seemingly traditional practices, such as circumcision, foot binding, and veiling to the currently fashionable, such as piercing, tattooing, dieting, and plastic surgery. By comparing body modification through space and time, we ask questions such as: Is contemporary anorexia similar to wearing the corset during the 19th century? Is female circumcision different from breast implants? Furthermore, we investigate how embodiment shapes personal and collective identities (especially gender identities) and vice versa."

Close attention will be paid to how socializing agents, including schools and the educational system, media and film, and families and local communities, shape and reshape formal efforts to have ordinary citizens internalize what Stuart Hall describes as \u201cthe horizon of the taken-for-granted,\u201d those ruling ideas and beliefs that consist \u201cof things that go without saying because, being axiomatic, they come without saying; things that, being presumptively shared, are not normally the subject of explication or argument.\u201d This course seeks to understand how such efforts succeed, falter, and change as they face the negotiations of the ordinary and the less powerful. Authors include Antonio Gramsci, Steven Lukes, James C. Scott, Clifford Geertz, Michel Foucault, Joel Migdal, Stuart Hall, and Robert Dahl."

But the Soviet era pursued science-fictional plans to redesign whole landscapes, make rivers flow backwards and even \n\n revolutionize plant genetics (Trofim Lysenko). In practice, such projects led to a shrinking Aral Sea, massive pollution of industrial and agricultural sites, and the worst nuclear disaster in human history (Chernobyl)\u2014at great human cost. Writers have both supported industrial transformation and resisted industrialization. This course will trace the evolution of these elements of Russian culture, focusing on expressions of ideology in literature.

This course examines a range of fresh water issues, comparing China and the U.S. Topics include dams and large-scale water projects (e.g., rerouting rivers); water pollution; groundwater depletion; industrial water use (e.g., for hydrofracking); impact of agricultural practices; urban storm water management; wetlands conservation; desertification; desalination. In the U.S. context especially, issues of water rights regimes and property rights, privatization, and commodification of water will receive attention. Which claims upon fresh water resources come first? What role do governments, transnational organizations, corporations, NGOs, and grassroots citizens\u2019 movements play in these water decisions? Guest lectures will emphasize science and engineering perspectives on water management. Chinese language ability desirable but not required."

Although it draws on examples from popular music and various non-Western repertories, the course focuses primarily on the art music of Europe and the United States. Prior musical training is not required. It is assumed that MUSI 001 students will not know how to read music. This course is taught with little or no use of musical notation."
